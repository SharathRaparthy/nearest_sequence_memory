# Nearest Sequence Memory for Hidden State Idenification

This repository is the reimplementation of the paper "[Instance-Based State Identification for Reinforcement Learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/932-instance-based-state-identification-for-reinforcement-learning.pdf)" by [R.Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/)

NSM is an instance-based algorithm for solving partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). Here NSM algorithm is applies to a partially obsevable version of McCallum's grid-world presented in figure below.
